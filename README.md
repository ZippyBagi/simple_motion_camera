A simple motion detection camera I made in order to track changes my room.

#In order to use

1. Run the myv vitual environmet(if on linux) or manually install dependancies on other os.

2. If you have multiple webcams change the zero in "cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)" to 1,2, or whatever camera number you wish to use

3. Run the Script!
